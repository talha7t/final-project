If a task has two input arcs, it is the same as if the task was preceded by:
XOR-join

Resource Utilization within a business process model is measured using:
Time spent per resource on process work ÷ Time available per resource for process work

Business Process Management life-cycle includes following:
Designing, Modeling, Execution, Monitoring and Optimization

To bridge the gap between Conceptual “to-be” process models to Executable process models we need:
all of above

Business Process Model and Notation or BPMN, is used to build complex business process model flowcharts, which are shared to targeted organizations and industries
True

Business process redesign is the continuous monitoring of business processes to effect small, but measurable improvements in cost reduction and value-added.
false

Which of the following is NOT a task?

If a task has two output arcs (also called flows), it is the same as if the task was followed by:
And-Split

External exceptions, Internal exceptions and Time out all are catching intermediate events. They stop the enclosing activities and start an exception handling routine.
true

Value chain:
All of above

The act of monitoring a process for its efficiency, a process that includes dimensions such as cost, timeliness, or quality is known as:
Process control

It forces the whole process to abort:
terminate event

Exceptions are events that deviate a process from its “normal” course
true 

Main elements of BPM:

It allow us to state that a task or a sub-process may be repeated multiple times:
activity loop markers

When something goes wrong outside the process, and the execution of the current activity must be interrupted. Handled with the Message event is :
external exception

Automated tasks are marked with:
all of above

It can happen all the time and for as intelligent as a modern system can be
Prcoess Exceptions

Manual tasks are marked with :
hand icon

User tasks are marked with :
User icon

Process Performance of a business process model is measured using:
Process Model + Performance of each activity

Cycle Time Efficiency of a business process model is measured using:
Processing Time ÷ Cycle Time

Performance Cost of a business process model is measured using:
Processing Cost + Cost of Waste

Cycle Time of a business process model is measured using:
Processing time + waiting time

What attempts to understand and measure the current process, and make performance improvements accordingly?
Continuous process Improvement

In an XOR-split gateway, one branch is chosen based on expressions evaluated over available data.

A generic term to refer to anyone or anything involved in the performance of a process activity:
resources

Gateways not are responsible for controlling how a business process flows:
false
